My name is Kyle Garza. I am currently a masters student at Texas State. I am working on an M.S. in pure mathematics. 
I have a B.S. in pure mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. I taught high school mathematics for 4 years 
in both public and charter schools here in Austin, and I have been privately tutoring students for the past 3 years both 
in person and over the internet.
