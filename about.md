My name is Kyle Garza. I am a recent graduate of Texas State University where I earned a Masters of Science in Pure Mathematics. I have a B.S. in pure mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. I taught high school mathematics for 4 years in both public and charter schools here in Austin, and I have been privately tutoring students for the past 6 years both in person and over the internet.

If you need help with a your high school or college math course. You may call/text Kyle Garza at (512) 299-1567, or email me at kyle.a.garza@gmail.com. Thanks!
